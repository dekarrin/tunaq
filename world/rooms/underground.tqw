description = '''
You are standing in the middle of a concrete, artificial tunnel underneath your house. At first it feels pitch black,
but your eyes slowly adjust and you can make out what's in here by the light of several bioluminescent mushrooms on
several of the walls.  There's a set of three antique doors dotting the walls of the hall. An oak one that says 'GLUB',
a maplewood one that says 'NAK', and a rosewood one that says 'THIP'. There's also a ladder leading to a hatch above
you, or you could head back through the tunnel to the backyard.

Yes $IF($FLAG_ENABLED(GRR)) Oh hey. That mark you scratched on the wall is still here. $ENDIF() spacer

You climb up the ladder and throw open the hatch. You go through and find yourself in complete darkness, and you trip
and accidentally slam the hatch shut behind you! Looks like you won't be going back that way. After fumbling about a bit
more, you find a door and walk out of your pantry into your kitchen.

symbols, and huge green and red text accompanied by a plus sign or minus as approriate flashing across the screens. This
place looks like the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange combined with a casino.  Strangely, it seems
completely deserted. Oh well. You guess you could head back NORTH through the maplewood door to the tunnel, once you're
done here.

You can hardly believe your eyes but, you're standing in an indoor swimming pool room. Well, a small one anyways.
There's various pool equipment and pool-side chairs lining a small pool about the size of a large sedan, and the air is
uncomfortably heavy with moisture. Whoever hung out here must have really enjoyed swimming.  You don't have a swimsuit
on you and you aren't confident enough that you're alone to risk go skinny-dipping, so all there is to do is go back
NORTH through the rosewood door to the tunnel.

someone saying 'glub' over and over again.  There is a door to the side with 'treasure' scrawled on a sign nearby.  From
