// Package buffalo contains parsers and parser-generator constructs used as part
// of research into compiling techniques. It is the tunascript compilers pulled
// out after it turned from "small knowledge gaining side-side project" into
// full-blown compilers and translators research.
//
// It's based off of the buffalo fish and also bison because of course.
//
// This will probably never be as good as bison, so consider using that. This is
// for research and does not seek to replace existing toolchains in any
// practical fashion.
